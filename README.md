## Description

This project is focused on predicting the likelihood of Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques. Specifically, it employs Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, along with dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to analyze a dataset of features and make predictions about Parkinson's disease susceptibility.

## Features

- Parkinson's disease prediction using SVM.
- Dimensionality reduction with PCA for feature engineering.
- Dataset provided for model training and evaluation.
- Customizable for additional features or improved models.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various features related to Parkinson's disease. It is included in this repository and is available in the `dataset` directory. The dataset is preprocessed and ready for use with the code.

## Code

The Python code for this project is included in the `src` directory. It covers data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction using PCA, SVM model training, and prediction. The code is well-documented and can be customized for your specific requirements.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (scikit-learn, numpy, pandas) installed.
3. Navigate to the `src` directory.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the code.
5. Follow the provided instructions in the code to load the dataset and make predictions.

## Usage

1. Configure the SVM model and PCA settings according to your needs.
2. Load the provided dataset or replace it with your own Parkinson's disease dataset.
3. Run the code to preprocess data, reduce dimensionality, and train the SVM model.
4. Use the trained model to predict the likelihood of Parkinson's disease based on input features.

Feel free to customize the code or experiment with additional features to improve the model's accuracy.
